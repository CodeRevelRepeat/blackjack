TODO:

Make PlayerHand class that extends Hand
Make DealerHand class that extends Hand

Make PlayerHand.hit call PlayerHand.stand when score >=21

Make PlayerHand.stand call Dealer.AI and DealerHand.reveal (or whatever)

Make ResultsView that watches DeckModel for win conditions and displays results
Make button appear with results to play another hand.
Make button reshuffle the deck when cards are less than INSERT_NUMBER_HERE




Maybe refactor out PlayerHand and DealerHand from Deck to AppModel
